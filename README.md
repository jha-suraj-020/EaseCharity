# EaseCharity

### Brief Description
This is a decentralised application on blockchain where people/NGOs can raise fund for campaigns. This proposes a better model of charity where money is not centralised in the hands of NGOs, where fund transfer is controlled by doners based on voting among them.

### Current Charity model
NGOs have centralized power over funds.
